        <summary><strong>📝 Complete Example: Improve JSDoc for a public method</strong></summary>

        ---

        **👾 Issue Description**

        The method `FileId.fromString()` in `src/file/FileId.js` is used by several examples and is part of the public API, but its JSDoc is minimal. It currently only has `@param {string} text` and `@returns {FileId}` with no description explaining the expected format or what the method does.

        Improving the JSDoc with a short description, a more detailed `@param` note (e.g. expected format like `"shard.realm.num"` or `"0.0.102"`), and an optional `@example` would help both IDE tooling and the [published JSDoc](https://hiero-ledger.github.io/hiero-sdk-js/) without changing any behavior.

        ---

        **💡 Proposed Solution**

        Add complete JSDoc to `FileId.fromString()`: a one-line summary (e.g. "Parses a file ID from its string representation"), improve the `@param {string} text` with a note on the expected format (e.g. `"shard.realm.num"`), and optionally add a short `@example` showing a typical call. No code logic changes—only comments.

        ---

        **🛠️ Implementation Steps**

        - [ ] Open `src/file/FileId.js` and locate the `fromString` static method (around line 66).
        - [ ] Add a one-line description above `@param`, e.g. "Parses a file ID from its string representation."
        - [ ] Improve the `@param` with format details, e.g. `@param {string} text - The file ID string in `shard.realm.num` format (e.g. `"0.0.102"`)`.
        - [ ] Optionally add `@example` with one or two lines, e.g. `FileId.fromString("0.0.102")`.
        - [ ] Run the linter to ensure nothing is broken: `pnpm lint`.
        - [ ] If the project has a script to generate JSDoc, run it locally to confirm the new docs appear as expected.
