        ## **Thanks for contributing!** 😊

        We truly appreciate your time and effort.

        This template is designed to help you create a **Beginner-friendly issue** —
        a moderately easy, well-scoped task that helps contributors build confidence
        and deepen their understanding of the **Hiero JS SDK** codebase.

        This issue is a great fit for contributors who are ready to explore the Hiero JavaScript
        codebase a little more and take on slightly more independent work. We strongly recommend
        completing a Good First Issue before tackling a Beginner Issue.

        Beginner Issues often involve reading existing JavaScript code, understanding how
        different parts of the SDK fit together, and making small, thoughtful updates
        that follow established patterns.

        The goal is to support skill growth while keeping the experience approachable,
        well-scoped, and enjoyable.

        > You’ll usually see Beginner Issues focused on things like:
        > - Small, well-scoped improvements to existing tests  
        > - Narrow updates to `src` functionality (e.g. refining helpers or improving readability)  
        > - Documentation or comment clarity  
        > - Enhancements to existing examples  
        >
        > Other types of contributions — such as brand-new features, broader system changes,
        > or deeper technical work — are just as valuable and may use different labels.

        Aim to explain the context, what needs to change, and the expected outcome
        without assuming deep knowledge of the codebase. The goal is to make the
        task feel understandable, well-scoped, and encouraging to take on.

        ## 👾 Description of the Issue — Example (JavaScript)

        The `TokenUpdateTransaction` class in `src/token/TokenUpdateTransaction.js`
        has a private `_tokenMemo` property that stores the memo for a token update,
        but there is no public getter to retrieve its current value.

        Adding a `get tokenMemo()` getter would allow developers to inspect the
        memo value after setting it, which is useful for validation and debugging.

        ## 💡 Proposed Solution — Example (JavaScript)

        Add a `get tokenMemo()` getter to `TokenUpdateTransaction` and a unit test
        to verify it works correctly.

        The changes should:
        - Add a getter that returns the `_tokenMemo` property
        - Follow the existing getter pattern used in the class
        - Add a unit test that sets a memo and verifies the getter returns it

        Beginner Issues often leave a little more room for exploration than Good First
        Issues, so it’s helpful to describe the overall approach, key files to look at,
        what to change, and how to check the result.

        ### 👩‍💻 Implementation — Example (JavaScript)

        **Step 1: Add the getter**

        - [ ] Open `src/token/TokenUpdateTransaction.js`
        - [ ] Find where other getters are defined (look for `get tokenId()` as a reference)
        - [ ] Add a new getter following the same pattern:
          ```javascript
          get tokenMemo() {
              return this._tokenMemo;
          }
          ```

        **Step 2: Add a unit test**

        - [ ] Open `test/unit/TokenUpdateTransaction.js`
        - [ ] Add a test that verifies the getter:
          ```javascript
          it("should return the token memo", function () {
              const memo = "test memo";
              const transaction = new TokenUpdateTransaction()
                  .setTokenMemo(memo);

              expect(transaction.tokenMemo).to.equal(memo);
          });
          ```

        **Step 3: Verify**

        - [ ] Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
